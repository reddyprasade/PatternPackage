# Python pattern programs

* Patterns can be printed in python using simple for loops. First outer loop is used to handle number of rows and Inner nested loop is used to handle the number of columns. Manipulating the print statements, different number patterns, alphabet patterns or star patterns can be printed.
* We will design the following Python pattern programs
* Number pattern
* Triangle pattern
* Star (*) or asterisk pattern
* Pyramid pattern
* Inverted pyramid pattern
* Half pyramid pattern
* Diamond Shaped pattern
* Characters or alphabets pattern
* Square pattern
